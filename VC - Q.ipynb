    "> How Hard Is It to Generate a 10X Return on an Investment?\n",
    "> ===============================\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Disclaimer: This post gets fairly detailed on venture math. I generally think it’s helpful for founders who take VC money to understand the business of their investors because it impacts their incentives and how they see the world. Those who have no interest in these sorts of topics should move on or go back to watching the price of BTC :)*\n",
    "\n",
    "> Every time I see blog posts referencing multiples on VC investments, I wonder if writers or readers appreciate how hard it is to generate these kinds of multiples and how multiples should really be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Obviously, the way to calculate a return multiple is to divide the amount returned from an investment by the dollars invested. If I invested \\$10M in a company and got back \\$100M, that’s a 10X return. Seems pretty straightforward, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The problem arises when multiples are inferred from incomplete data.** It’s quite rare that anybody but the fund manager actually knows the dollars out and dollars returned by a specific investment. And if you have incomplete data, there are usually a number of things that go into calculating or estimating the return. Here are a few other things to think about."
