Jupyter Notebooks
================================================================================

### Discover Jupyter

[Project Jupyter] is the homepage of the non-profit behind the Jupyter Notebook.

The project provides **Try Jupyter!**, 
a perfect tool to get started with notebooks:

  - It runs on your browser and t is hosted [in the cloud][Rackspace]
    (you don't have to install anything on your computer).

  - It is free and doesn't require any registration.

  - You can't break anything
    (or rather if you do, it doesn't matter).

  - It doesn't keep your data.

### Markdown 

The "document cells" of notebooks use the Markdown syntax.
The site of [CommonMark] (a standard for this language) hosts:

  - a [Markdown Quick Reference]: cheat sheet

  - a [Markdown Dingus]: online Markdown editor

  - a [Markdown Tutorial]: mini-course with exercises


### Notebookify Everything!

### Use Jupyter Notebooks (Like a Pro)

**Try Jupyter!** is nice to get started but has many limitations
(to begin with, when too many people are using it, you won't be
able to start it!). 
If you get serious about theis notebook thing, consider the following options:

  - [Install the Jupyter Notebook] on your computer.

  - [Install JupyterHub] on a server to support multiple users 
    (or [ask politely your favorite I.T. guy to do it][HJ]).

  - Try the [Microsoft Azure Notebooks] to host your Jupyter notebooks in the cloud; 
    requires a (free) Microsoft account.

  - [Binder] (beta): interact with notebooks stored in a [GitHub] repository; 
    also in the cloud.
