Jupyter Notebooks
================================================================================

### Discover Jupyter

[Project Jupyter] is the homepage of the non-profit behind the Jupyter Notebook.

The project provides **Try Jupyter!** a tool that is perfect to get started with notebooks:

  - It is hosted [in the cloud][Rackspace];
    you don't have to install anything on your computer.

  - It is free and doesn't require any registration.

  - You can't break anything
    (or rather if you do, it doesn't matter).

  - It doesn't keep your data.

### Markdown 

The "document cells" of notebooks use the Markdown syntax.
The site of [CommonMark] (a standard for this language) hosts:

  - a [Markdown Quick Reference]: cheat sheet

  - a [Markdown Dingus]: online Markdown editor

  - a [Markdown Tutorial]: mini-course with exercises


### Notebookify

### Use Jupyter Notebook

  - [Install the Jupyter Notebook] on your computer.

  - [Install JupyterHub] on a server to support multiple users 
    (or [ask politely your favorite I.T. guy to do it][HJ]).

  - Try the [Microsoft Azure Notebooks] to host your Jupyter notebooks in the cloud; 
    requires a (free) Microsoft account.

  - [Binder] (beta): interact with notebooks stored in a [GitHub] repository; 
    also in the cloud.  
    For example, [use this repository](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/boisgera/MEDIANE/master).
